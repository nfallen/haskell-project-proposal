CIS 552 Project Proposal
========================
Nova Fallen (nfallen)
Regina Burd (rburd)

Project Goal
============
The goal of this project is to build a program that automatically derives NFA and minimal DFA representations of any inputted regular expression. This would ideally serve as a convenient way for computer scientists and students of automata theory to study the manner in which regular languages can be computed/recognized by finite state machines. Time permitting, we would also add a tool to allow users to visualize the resulting machine. 

Use Case
========

Components
==========
Datatype to represent valid regular expressions 
Regex parser to get strings into that datatype 
Datatype to represent NFA 
Algorithm to convert regex to NFA 
Datatype to represent DFA 
Algorithm to convert NFA to minimal DFA 


Effort Budget
=============

*Add stuff on refactoring and debugging
